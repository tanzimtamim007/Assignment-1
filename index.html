            <p>A food pyramid is a food chart shaped like a pyramid. This food chart shows the importance of different
                food groups from the bottom to the top of the pyramid. The bottom line food group is the most important
                and top food group is the least important. A food pyramid indicates which foods we should eat much and
                which foods less.</p>
